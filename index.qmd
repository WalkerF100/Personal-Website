Hello, my name is Walker Fryar, and I'm a student at Colorado State University. I'm currently working towards a Professional Science Master's in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability with a focus in Sustainable Food Systems. With my degree, I am planning on going into agricultural consulting to help farmers and ranchers implement more sustainable practices.

Feel free to explore this website to learn more about me and my experiences!
